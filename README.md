As part of my media studies class which focused on using code in a
                    non-traditional way for Computer Science students. I used the JavaScript
                    library P5.js to create an interactive and animated screen. I chose to
                    recreate the <i>GoodWood Festival of Speed</i>, with a focus on featuring
                    the McLaren MP4/4 Formula 1 car from 1988. <br/><br/>
                    The aim of this class for me was to expand my coding knowledge beyond
                    what is typically taught. I wanted to find a way to use code in a way I hadn't
                    done prior, and this allowed me express myself in a creative and free way that
                    is not possible with application or web development.
